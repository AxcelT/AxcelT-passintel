# AxcelT-passintel
A lightweight Python-based password auditing tool that checks password strength and breach status using a custom AWS Lambda API and the HaveIBeenPwned service. Prioritizes privacy by using hashed communication and secure API practices.

## Project Overview

AxcelT-passintel is designed as a CLI tool that:
- Securely accepts a password using Python's `getpass`.
- Hashes the password (using SHA1, for example) to protect plaintext.
- Checks the hashed password against the HaveIBeenPwned API to determine if itâ€™s been compromised.
- Analyzes password strength based on factors like length and complexity.

This tool serves as a portfolio project for demonstrating both cybersecurity fundamentals and practical Python/cloud integration skills.
